- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @missedBoat
- Iâ€™m interested in developing my skills, trying front and back end development and increasing my skills.
- I'm developing different apps and working on ideas, but i am mostly self taught. I went through a bootcamp which was mid to say the least, but a fairly good starting off point.
